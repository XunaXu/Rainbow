###Hi There! Thanks for taking some time to get to know me.

I am a programmer and enjoy writing code, but anything beyond that becomes a bit challenging and very time consuming, especially it comes to writing. However, I have always wanted to have my own blog site, so I have to try my best to come up something readable and useful.


###Becoming A Programmer

Math was never hard for me, so its not a surprise that I enjoy programming. After one year of a commerce degree at the university, none of it made any sense to me. I always like visual arts, but I was hesitant to pursue it as a career, so I thought it would be good to combine the art and math together. A bachelor of computer graphics from the engineering department was on offer at that time. 75% programming and 25% design courses sounded great.


###Javascript? Yes

My first programming language was html, javascript and the web stuff in high school. Java was the major language taught at university, and I got to know algorithms and structures which I do like and is barely used now. After graduated from the university, I have become a front end software engineer and been using Javascript for past five years. The language itself has been transformed, and the community is really amazing.


###Other Than Coding

I like watching documentaries, sometimes read books. Since last year I have been spending a fair chunk of my time at the gym on chasing abs.
