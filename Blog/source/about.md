### Hey There!   

Thanks for taking some time to get to know me. 

I am not a writer, not even a terrible one. I am a programmer. I enjoy writing code and functions and mathematic equations, but anything beyond that becomes a bit challenging and very time consuming. Because I have always wanted to have my own blog site, I have to try my best to come up something nice for you, and please keep it in mind that I am not a native Enligh speaker. <br><br>



### Became A Programmer

Math was never hard for me, so its not a surprise that I enjoy programming. I got into it by accident,  Ooops! After one year of a commerce degree at the university, none of it made any sense to me. I always like visual arts, but I was hesitant to pursue it as a career, so I thought it would be good to combine the art and math together. Guess what? A bachelor of computer graphics from the engineering department was on offer for the first time (they have stopped the degree after several years). 75% programming, and 25% design courses sounded too great.<br><br>



### Javascript? Yes

My first programming language was html, javascript and the web stuff in high school. Java was the major language taught at university at that time, and I got to know algorithms and structures which I do like. Anyway, fast forward the time. I have learnt lots of languages at school or at work or at my leisure, such as Java, Javascript, PHP, C++, C-sharp, Objective C, ActionScript... Javascript has been transformed in recent years, the open source community is amazing. I am so sad I have missed the Renaissance by several centuries, but I am determined not to miss this one. It is happening right now!<br><br>


### Other Than Coding

Apart from programming, I am an atheist, love pretty much all documentaries, sometimes read books. Since last year I have been spending a fair chunk of my time at the gym on chasing abs. <br><br>



### Extra

I used to think I can be whoever I wanna be. Gradually over time I notice I couldn't be anybody else but only myself, and nobody else in the world can be me. I am still on a journey to learn who I am, luckily I can say 'I know myself a bit more than I used to.' It would be a terrible feeling if I know less. I believe how we would deal with situations defines who we are, and we have abilities to change how we perceive the world. <br><br>
